Python Interpreter : Python is an interpreted language.The Python interpreter runs the program by executing one line at a time going in a line by line fashion.

IPython is an enhanced python interpreter where you execute blocks of code in  the cells. So by using jupyter which uses ipyton notebooks with .ipynb(interactive python notebook) you can can execute seperate blocks of code in the form of cells individually.

You can either use the run button or use a keyboard shortcut(Shift+Enter) to run reach cell after the kernel gets started.

Using <Tab> you will get operation and variable suggestions which almost acts as a autocomplete making your coding experience easy.
  
You can use introspection to know about any specific variable or function by using ? beside it and veiw its source code in the case of functions by using ??.

You can view all the magic commands by executing " %quickref " in a cell to get an idea about them.
